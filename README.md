# ChessBookScanner
Ideally, this will be able to combine chess board computer vision with text parsing to automatically pull out games from the text of a chess book. 
Possible ideas: 
 - Use ChessBoardScanner to find diagrams and generate FEN files. 
 - Use preprocessing to add text layer over pdfs w/o searchable text. 
 - Find movesets in the text. Difficulty is in alternate lines. Likely have to deal with that in PGN.
